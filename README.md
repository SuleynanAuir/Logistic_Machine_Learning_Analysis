This is a TA meterial for Machine Learning basics and must-know opertion. Overall implementation is without Machine Learning open source library, instead, it's all by basic scientific library (like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn...). So, it will help you have a better understand of how you can master the underlying architecture of ML algorithm
